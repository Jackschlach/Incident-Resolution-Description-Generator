  Incident Resolution Description Generator

This is a tool I built to turn messy incident notes into clear, professional resolution summaries. It uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT model to take a rough paragraph and generate a structured, polished response using our specific format you can use in tickets or reports.

I work in Digital Operations at NBA, so I made this to speed up writing and keep resolution descriptions in a consistent format.


What it does: 

- Takes a raw paragraph about what happened
- Generates a polished incident resolution description
- You can choose the **tone** (formal, casual, technical, etc.)


Tech used:

- Python 3.13  
- OpenAI (GPT-3.5-turbo)  
- Flask (for local testing)  
- HTML/CSS (simple UI)  
- AWS Lambda (for deployment)(coming soon)
